# AIML4OS – Work Package 12 (WP12): Large Language Models for Official Statistics

Welcome to the official repository for **Work Package 12 (WP12)** of the EU-funded project **AIML4OS – Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Official Statistics**.

## Purpose of this Repository

This repository collects all publicly shareable outputs, experiments, and prototypes developed within WP12, which explores the potential of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to create value for statistical organisations across Europe.

WP12 focuses on:
- Prototyping use cases where LLMs can support or enhance statistical production (e.g. data handling, code translation, chatbot interfaces, and large document analysis).
- Analysing architectural implications and governance aspects of integrating LLM-based tools in public sector workflows.
- Exploring reusability and reproducibility across organisations, including with open-source and cloud-based tools.

This repository is meant to serve as a working space where ongoing development and early deliverables are documented and shared with the broader community involved in the AIML4OS project.

> ⚠️ **Note**: All content in this repository is currently under active development and experimentation. The examples and code provided are intended for demonstration and learning purposes only. They are not production-ready and should not be used in live systems.
