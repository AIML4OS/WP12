# WP12 Hackathon - Lisbon 2025

This folder contains the outputs from the two-day WP12 hackathon held in **Lisbon, June 2025**, with participation from project members representing **Portugal, the Netherlands, Sweden, Ireland, and Norway**, and with **technical support from France**, who, through WP3, delivers the shared data lab infrastructure (SSPCloud) used in the AIML4OS project.

## 🎯 Objectives of the Hackathon

The goals of the hackathon were to:
- Facilitate cross-country collaboration and knowledge exchange on LLM-based applications
- Explore different technical approaches for using large language models (LLMs) in official statistics
- Create a first working draft of **Deliverable D12.1**, including concrete and testable prototypes

## 🧩 Evaluation Framework

To support sustainability and maintainability of AI systems developed within the project, each use case and prototype was evaluated along the following dimensions:

- **Efficiency gain**
- **Reusability**
- **Data accessibility**
- **On-prem compatibility**
- **Low-hanging fruit (for NSIs)**
- **Evaluation robustness**
- **Feasibility**
- **Lifespan**

## 🏗️ Architecture Perspective

An architecture perspective was introduced at the start of the hackathon to guide prototype development and encourage conscious choices around components such as:

- AI models (LLMs)
- APIs
- Frameworks

A generic reference model was used as a starting point and extended by each group. The shared architecture diagram can be found here:

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each prototype folder contains:

- A clear description of the **use case**
- Evaluation summary based on the above criteria
- A **mapping to architectural components** used
- Code and/or scripts that can be used to understand and test the prototype, especially within the **SSPCloud (Onyxia)** environment

These examples are also adaptable for use **outside of SSPCloud**, though minor changes may be required to fit other environments.

## First steps to start...

The projects within this repository require an API key. To retrieve it, you'll need an SSP Cloud account. If it's not already done, create an account on the [SSP Cloud](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/) platform.  Then, to get your api key, go to [the AI chatbot hosted on the platform](https://llm.lab.sspcloud.fr) > settings > account > API KEYS 

Add your api key in an environment variable (LLM_API_KEY), to do so, in a terminal : 
```export LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key_you_just_retrieved"```
