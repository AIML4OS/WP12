# Web Corner Prototype

This prototype explores the potential of **modern web scraping techniques combined with Large Language Models (LLMs)** to support targeted content detection on web pages. The primary use case involves determining whether a given web page contains information related to a specific variable or concept, such as:

> "Does this web page contain a job vacancy page?"
> "Is this website representing an accommodation site"
> ...

## üß† Use Case Description

### Input
- A list of URLs provided by the user
- A target **variable/criterion** (e.g., ‚Äújob vacancy‚Äù, "hotel", ‚Äúevent listing‚Äù, ‚Äústatistical publication‚Äù)

### Output
- A binary **yes/no** response for each URL indicating whether the target variable is matched
- Optionally, a short justification or confidence score provided by the LLM (not yet)
- A feature representation (email address, social media, etc.) (not yet)

This type of workflow may support NSIs in automating web monitoring tasks for statistical content detection, e.g., for labor market indicators or price collection.

## üìå Evaluation Summary

During the WP12 hackathon, the use-case was evaluated using the following dimensions:

| Parameter              | Assessment |
|------------------------|------------|
| Efficiency gain        | High       |
| Reusability            | High       |
| Data accessibility     | High       |
| On-prem compatible     | Mid        |
| Low-hanging fruit (for NSIs) | Mid  |
| Feasibility            | Mid        |
| Lifespan               | Mid        |
| Evaluation robustness  | Low        |

These assessments reflect the high potential for automation and cross-domain application, with caveats around evaluation precision and long-term stability of web content.
