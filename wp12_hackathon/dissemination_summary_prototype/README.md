# Dissemination Summary Prototype

This prototype explores a practical use-case where a statistician produces a report with analysis based on published statistical data. In dissemination workflows, it is often necessary to create a **summary of the report** in both the **local language** (e.g., Portuguese) and **English**, along with a set of **keywords or tags** that describe the subject areas of the report.

The goal of this prototype is to evaluate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can support and streamline this summarisation process in a way that is **reusable, transferable and compatible** with statistical organisations‚Äô needs and constraints.

## üß† Use Case Description

### Input
A report document in PDF format, typically written by a subject-matter expert or analyst within a statistical office.

### Process
An AI-powered workflow performs the following steps:
1. **PDF Ingestion and Processing** ‚Äì Text is extracted and prepared for semantic search.
2. **RAG Pipeline Setup** ‚Äì The processed content is fed into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.
3. **LLM Prompting** ‚Äì A structured prompt generates:
   - A short **summary** of the document in both local language and English.
   - A set of **keywords/tags** describing the thematic content.
4. **Output Delivery** ‚Äì Results are returned to the user for review or integration into the publication pipeline.

## üîç Evaluation Parameters

During the WP12 hackathon, this use-case was evaluated using the following criteria:

| Parameter              | Assessment      |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| Reusability            | High            |
| Data accessibility     | High            |
| On-prem compatibility  | High            |
| Low-hanging fruit (for NSIs) | High    |
| Feasibility            | High            |
| Lifespan               | High            |
| Efficiency gain        | Mid             |
| Evaluation robustness  | Low to mid      |

These evaluations reflect the group‚Äôs view on the potential of the solution to be adapted and reused in different national statistical institutes (NSIs), especially where document-based dissemination is common.
